# Circle Intersection Calculator

This is a circle intersection calculator implemented as an algorithm project for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course. The calculator takes input for two circles and determines their intersection points, if any.

## Usage

1. Enter the coordinates and radii of the two circles in the corresponding input fields.
2. Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the intersection points.
3. The intersection points will be displayed in the intersection label.
4. The circles and their intersection points will be visualized in the canvas.

## Features

- Calculates the intersection points of two circles.
- Handles various cases, including circles inside each other, separate circles, and overlapping circles.
- Displays clear error messages for invalid inputs.
- Provides a button to clear the input fields and reset the canvas.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the calculator:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Python GUI library)

## How to Run

1. Install Python if it's not already installed on your system.
2. Install Tkinter using the package manager or command prompt:
   - `pip install tk` (for Python 3.x)
3. Save the code to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `circle_intersection_calculator.py`).
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5. Run the script using the following command:
   - `python circle_intersection_calculator.py`
6. The Circle Intersection Calculator window should open, and you can interact with the calculator.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the user interface with additional features and visualizations.
- Allow the user to choose different shapes and calculate their intersections.
- Implement more advanced algorithms for circle intersection calculation.
- Add support for different coordinate systems and units.
- Enhance error handling and provide more informative error messages.
