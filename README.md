# Circle Intersection Calculator

This is a circle intersection calculator implemented as an algorithm project for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course. The calculator takes input for two circles and determines their intersection points, if any.

## Usage

1. Enter the coordinates and radii of the two circles in the corresponding input fields.
2. Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the intersection points.
3. The intersection points will be displayed in the intersection label.
4. The circles and their intersection points will be visualized in the canvas.

## Features

1.	Intersection Point Calculation: It calculates the intersection points between two circles based on their coordinates and radii.
2.	Handling Various Cases: It handles different scenarios such as circles inside each other, separate circles, and overlapping circles, providing accurate results for each case.
3.	Draw Circles and Points: It draws a scaled version of the circles and their intersection points on the canvas based on an imaginary Cartesian Coordinate Plane to accurately position the circles and the intersection points. 
4.	Error Handling: It displays clear error messages in case of invalid inputs, such as negative radius values.
5.	Reset Functionality: It provides a "Clear" button that clears the input fields and resets the canvas, allowing users to start fresh calculations.


## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the calculator:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Python GUI library)

## How to Run

1. Install Python if it's not already installed on your system.
2. Install Tkinter using the package manager or command prompt:
   - `pip install tk` (for Python 3.x)
3. Save the code to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `circle_intersection_calculator.py`).
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5. Run the script using the following command:
   - `python circle_intersection_calculator.py`
6. The Circle Intersection Calculator window should open, and you can interact with the calculator.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the user interface with additional features and visualizations.
- Allow the user to choose different shapes and calculate their intersections.
- Implement more advanced algorithms for circle intersection calculation.
- Add support for different coordinate systems and units.
- Enhance error handling and provide more informative error messages.
